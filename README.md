# WalkingWithZombies
My Computer Science final year project at the University of Leeds - walking with zombies in virtual reality using the HTC Vive headset and Unreal Engine 4

This project is created in Unreal Engine 4, version 4.19

On opening the project, the main level automatically appears: This is the most complex level with a combination of camera effects and lighting fog to create a suitable atmosphere for zombies.

There are two other functional levels: a maze level and a test level.

Maze level: this is designed to be run on the PC and is used to test navigation of the two types of crowd agents I have designed.
Test level: this is also designed to be run on the PC and tests the collision management of the zombie crowd agents.
